(1) pRealm
    o Subscribes for REALMCAST_REQ and REALMCAST_REQ_VNAME
      The latter for when non uField mode like alpha mission since PMV will likely
      always publish either REALMCAST_REQ_ALL or REALMCAST_REQ_VNAME

(2) REALMCAST_REQ content on pMarineViewer
    o channel=app, mask=community,source,time
    Anything else? Duration needed? No threshold
    
    pRealm just generates for N seconds after receiving a request

(3) pRealm
    o fix the timestamp issue
    o handle channel changes

(4) PMV_GUI - perhaps only one set of Browser widgets, and just change the
    content/color etc.


Remember an app is a channel but we may add other channels later on, e.g.
- custom watch list, or history on a single var
- everything received from shoreside
- everything received from other vehicles
- behavior output

It seems that getFormattedString falls into an infinite loops when pRealm is
processing DBVARSUMMARY, which is heavily formatted. Can we detect which types
of incoming mail are bad? Can we figure out why getFormattedString gets stuck
in an infinte loop?

History - for string variables just keep one. For Double variables keep 20 (configurable)?

Optional variable channel:

App:pOne
--------
VAR  TIME  VALUE

App:pTwo
--------
VAR  TIME  VALUE
