RUNNING:
==========================================
To test the cases in this file:

$ ./verify.sh test*

Will return zero if all test cases succeed, 1 otherwise.


HELP:
==========================================
$ verify.sh --help


TEST FILE STRUCTURE
==========================================
Each file contains pairs of blocks:

(1) A "_beg*.txt" file is a "beginning" file.
(2) A "_tar*.txt" file is a "target" file.

Running nsplug should produce a "result" file, "_res.txt" that
matches the target file.

The first line of the beg file contains the nsplug arguments that
are presumed to be applied to produce the result file.

A test succeeds if "diff -B -b" succeeds (ret 0) when applied to
the result and target files.

VERIFY SCRIPT
==========================================
The verify script will (a) parse all the test files into the
prescribed beg and tar files, and (b) proceed to run nsplug on
each beg file, comparing the results at each step.

SCRIPT OUTPUT:
==========================================
Successful outpus should look like:
